│   └── browse_stories.py  # Story browsing and filtering
├── utils/                 # Core utility modules
│   ├── data_manager.py    # Database operations and data handling
│   ├── database.py        # Database connection and schema
│   └── image_handler.py   # Image processing and storage
├── models/                # AI and ML processing

### Database Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE stories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    original_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    translated_text TEXT,
    detected_language VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(100),
    region VARCHAR(100),
    community VARCHAR(100),
    story_type VARCHAR(50),
    language_hint VARCHAR(50),
    image_path VARCHAR(255),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
